# startup
## A startup project.
#### Greatest startup in all the land.
Don't mess with the best.\
That's what's up. :sunglasses:

I learned quite a bit from this assignment! I learned that, when working with others, it's important to push and pull changes frequently to protect against merge conflicts. I also learned that VS Code is really handy in helping prevent a lot of issues.


### ELEVATOR PITCH
Don't you hate it when you crack open a fortune cookie, and it says something bogus? Most fortune cookies you get at your favorite Chinese restaurant are advice cookies, mantra cookies, or informational fact cookies. Well, that all changes with the Actual Fortune Cookie app. Anyone who creates an account can crack open a cookie, which will reveal a message that actually predicts your future in some way. You can save your favorites, or share them to a board which can be viewed by anyone else with the app. Because who doesn't need just a little more luck in their lives?
